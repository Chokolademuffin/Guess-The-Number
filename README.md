# Project Title: 💡 Guess the Number Game 💡

### Description:

Welcome to the 🔮 Guess the Number game! This simple C++ code creates a fun guessing game where the computer picks a random number between 1 and 100, and the user tries to guess it.

### Features:

🔢 Random Number Generation: The code generates a random number between 1 and 100 that the user needs to guess.

🎯 User Input and Feedback: The user is prompted to enter their guess, and the program provides feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low.

🔢 Attempts Count: The program keeps track of the number of attempts it takes for the user to guess the correct number.

### How to Play:

📥 Clone or download the repository to your local machine.

🛠️ Compile the C++ code using your preferred C++ compiler (e.g., g++ or Visual C++).

▶️ Run the generated executable (e.g., guess_number.exe).

🤔 The program will prompt you to enter a guess for the secret number.

🔁 Continue guessing until you guess the correct number.

🎉 The program will congratulate you and display the number of attempts it took to guess the correct number.

Have fun playing the Guess the Number game and see if you can beat your previous attempts! Feel free to contribute, report issues, or suggest improvements to make the game even better.

Please note that this is a simple command-line based game, and you'll need a C++ compiler to build and run the executable. Happy gaming! 😄
